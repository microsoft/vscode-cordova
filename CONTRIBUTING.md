## Development setup

We welcome any quality bugfixes or contributions!

To avoid conflicts with your existing installation, it is recommended to delete the installed extension at:

- **Linux and macOS**: `~/.vscode/extensions/msjsdiag.vscode-cordova-<version>`
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\<username>\.vscode\extensions\msjsdiag.vscode-cordova-<version>`

### Clone the repository

- `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cordova.git` to any preferrable folder
- `cd` to the folder you just cloned
- Run `npm install -g gulp` and `npm ci`
- Run `gulp`
- After completing above steps, run `gulp release` to package extension `.vsix` file. A VSIX package can help you install the latest extension maunally in VS Code extension tab.

## Debugging

To debug the extension process itself and the debug adapter it provides, in VS Code run the `Launch Extension` debug target which will spawn a new instance of VS Code with the extension installed. You can set breakpoints in the Typescript and debug things such as extension activation and the command palette.

## Testing

There is a set of mocha tests for the debug adapter which can be run with `npm test`, and a set of mocha tests for the other functionality run as part of the `test` launch config. Also run `gulp eslint` to check your code against our `eslint` rules.

See the project under `test/testProject/` for a sample project that should build and compile, allow debugging of plugins and merges, and enable Intellisense for plugins.

## Sending PR

Your pull request should:

- Include a clear description of the change
- Be a child commit of a reasonably recent commit in the **master** branch
  - Requests need not be a single commit, but should be a linear sequence of commits (i.e. no merge commits in your PR)
- It is desirable, but not necessary, for the tests to pass at each commit
- Have clear commit messages
  - e.g. "Refactor feature", "Fix issue", "Add tests for issue"
- Include adequate tests
  - At least one test should fail in the absence of your non-test code changes. If your PR does not match this criteria, please specify why
  - Tests should include reasonable permutations of the target fix/change
  - Include baseline changes with your change
- Ensure there are no linting issues (`gulp eslint`)
- To avoid line ending issues, set `autocrlf = input` and `whitespace = cr-at-eol` in your git configuration
